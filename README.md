## Acknowledgements
This was possible thanks to Dr. Angela and her course from Udemy: The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart. This app is the cumulation of all the things I learned from data management to cloud storage. The code is my own but the app idea and most of the content is in reference to her teachings.
